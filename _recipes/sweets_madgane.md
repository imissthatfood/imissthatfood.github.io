# Method

Soak rice for an hour.

Grind coconut and prepare coconut milk.

Keep thin and thick milk separately.

Cook Bengal gram and cashewnuts and keep ready.

Grind the rice in the thin coconut milk.

While cooking the rice paste if it becomes too thick, you can add some water.

When the ground rice is cooked and comes to the boiling point, add cooked dhal and cashewnuts.

Put jaggery in and keep stirring.

When done, add the thick coconut juice, just boil, add cardamom powder and take it off the flame.

It is better to cook this in a thick bottomed vessel.
