# Method

Heat the ghee, take it off the fire and mix in the cocoa, sugar and milk.

Cook on a medium fire.

When it is all melted and thick, add the coconut.

When the mixture drops from the spoon, add the vanilla essence.

Place in rough lumps on wax paper, decorate with cherries and allow it to cool.

Take the mixture off the stove when the liquid is all absorbed, do not allow it to separate into little bits.

However if that does happen, you can reheat, on a slow fire adding just a little water.
