# Method

Green peas gashi can be made with the above masala with the onion seasoning.

Cook green peas with salt. 

When cooked, add the masala and season.

 A potato can be added while cooking peas so that the curry blends well (smooth consistency). 
 
A fine masala enhances the taste of the curry.

A similar ghushi can be made with dry peas. 

If dry peas are used it should be soaked overnight and then cooked in a pressure cooker.

Gashi can also be prepared with black or kabuli channa. 

Channa should be soaked in water overnight with 1/4 teaspoon soda bicarbonate. 

White chana cooks in 12- minutes. 

Black chana takes 30 ins to cook. 

Channa should be cooked after washing.

Seasoning with oil mustards seeds and curry leaves.
 
 
Bendi is slightly more spicy than gashi. 

Add a couple more chillies and a little more tamarind.

Grind fine.

Seasoning is with garlic and oil. 
 
Bendi can be prepared with tingalevra bagde horse gram etc.

Can be just washed and cooked. Raw jackfruit, yam, mage etc can be added after cooking the grams.
