_This is U. Loy and Felcy’s recipe. They always made it at the barbeques they had at “The Harvest”. Now I never have a barbeque without a huge bowl of this chutney. Chandru loves this chutney._

# Ingredients

* 1 big lump of tamarind
* 2 big onions (chopped into rings)
* 2 tablespoons chopped coriander
* 2 tablespoons chopped pudina
* 2 tablespoons chopped chillies
* 1-2 tablespoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

# Method

Soak the tamarind in warm water and then squeeze well to remove the pulp. (Thick juice)

Discard all the seeds and the fibre.

Then mix in the rest of the ingredients, preferably by hand as that allows the onion juice to mix well with the tamarind.
