_When I used to make this earlier, I always landed up with lumps of custard. Not anymore. It usually comes out smooth, the trick is to keep the fire low, keep stirring. If disaster strikes and lumps do form, you have two options, one to run it through the blender, but then you land up with bubbles, which take some time to disintegrate or sieve the custard, which works really well._
