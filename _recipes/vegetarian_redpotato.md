# Method

Grind together red chillies with garlic and geera.

Dice. Fry the masala well, add dhania and geera powder, salt and haldi and fry till the oil comes up.

Add potatoes.

Add a little tamarind juice.

Sprinkle with coriander.
 
_I usually add a tablespoon of ketchup and sour lime juice too. Mellows the flavour._
