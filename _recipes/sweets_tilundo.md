# Method

Wash and clean til, drain water and spread on a towel to dry. When dry, roast til in small lots till they puff.

Heat jaggery with 1 cup water in a kadai and make into syrup. 

When the syrup boils, test its consistency (by putting a drop into a glass of water. 

The syrup is done when it forms into a lump in the water).

When done, add ghee and cardamom powder and take off flame.

Add the til and mix till the syrup is saturated.

Cool the mixture.

Grease palms with a little ghee and make into small undos

Option : Can add roasted, skinned, finely chopped groundnuts along with the til to the syrup.
