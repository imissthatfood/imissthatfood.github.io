# Method



Grind together coconut, red chillies, salt, hing water, tamarind and jaggery (if being used) to a consistency that is neither too coarse nor too smooth.

Lay one leaf rear-side up on a tray and spread the masala evenly on it.

Lay another leaf (rear-side up) on the masala and spread the masala on this.

Make alternating layers of leaf and masala with ten similar-sized leaves so that the thickness of the layers is uniform.

Fold in the sides of the leaves to the centre and spread masala on the surface of the folds.

Now roll the leaves from the bottom tip to the top.

Slice the roll into ½’’ thick rounds.

Make similar rolls with the remaining leaves and masala.

Steam in a cooker (without shutting the pressure vent) for 15-20 minutes.

Serve with coconut oil.
