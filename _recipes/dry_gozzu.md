# Method

Wash, skin and cut the ridge gourd into squares.

Skin and cook in just enough water.

Crush coconut gratings, green chillies salt and a little tamarind

Add the cooked vegetables and mash well. 

Put some hing water and a teaspoon of coconut oil before serving.

When Gozzu is made with brinjal, it is called bajji.

Instead of cooking the brinjal, it is roasted on the gas.
 
The skin should be removed after roasting and then mixed with crushed coconut gratings, 
green chillies, tamarind, and salt.

 Hing and coconut oil should be added last.
