# Method

Cook vegetables with enough water and salt till soft.

Grind masala with coconut, red chillies and tamarind to smooth consistency and add to cooked vegetables.

Bring to boil and cook till curry is semi-solid consistency.

Season oil, mustard seeds and curry leaves.

Option – If ambada is used instead of tamarind, crush and add to vegetables when almost cooked.
