# Method

Soak rice for three hours.

Wash and grind the soaked rice with grated coconut and salt. 

Make a smooth batter to a consistency thinner than dosa batter (but not watery).

Pour the batter in a kadai and stir on a medium fire till its consistency is suitable for rolling into balls.

Take off flame and let cool.
 Make cylindrical rolls of about 3” length and 3” diameter.

Steam the rolls in a cooker (without shutting the pressure vent) for about ten minutes till the rolls are well-cooked.

Press the roll in a shevanyi press to make shevanyis.

Serve with coconut oil and coconut rosu.
