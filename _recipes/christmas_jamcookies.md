# Method

Mix all ingredients except cashew together.

Make small balls.

Dip in egg white, coat in grated cashews and make a dip on the top.

The original way is to put jam in the dip, but lots of people put glace cherries. Your choice.

Place on a greased thali and bake till light brown on the base.
