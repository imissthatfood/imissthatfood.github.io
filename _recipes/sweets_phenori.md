# Method

Make a dough of puri consistency with the maida, salt and water.

First roll 4 balls as thin as possible, dusting with maida.

Keep 1 rolled Roti, spread liquid ghee on it, sprinkle rice flour of rava evenly.

Keep the 2nd Roti and repeat, but the Roti should be 1/2 inch below the first.
