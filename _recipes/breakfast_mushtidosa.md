# Method

Soak rice and dhal together for 2 hours.

Wash and grind together rice, dhal, coconut gratings and methi.

Add salt before removing.

Put beaten rice in a vessel and then add the ground mixture.

Keep aside water removed after washing the grinder.

Add it to make the batter to the required consistency.

Keep overnight.

The batter should ferment well.

Make dosa which are not too thin, just put the batter on the tava and spread very little.

Cover and cook.

These dosas need not be flipped.
