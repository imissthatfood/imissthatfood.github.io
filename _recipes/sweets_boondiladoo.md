# Method

Make the besan batter with water to the consistency of idli batter.

Make Boondi, frying in ghee, in a Boondi ladle.

In a kadai, put the sugar, and just enough water to cover the sugar.

Heat.

The sugar should just melt, and the syrup should be just sticky.

Remove from the flame, add cardamom powder, 1 tbsp. ghee, raisins and colour.

Mix in the Boondi, and cool stirring once every five minutes. Make ladoos.

Press them again when done so that they have a perfect round shape.
