# Method

Soak rice for an hour, wash and grind with 2 tbsp. grated coconut. 

When smooth, add freshly soaked beaten rice and grind a little. 

Add 2 tbsp. jaggery powder and salt and grind. 

Make a batter, thinner than dosa batter consistency.

Make ‘choorna’ by mixing remaining jaggery powder with laayi pitto, coconut gratings and cardamom powder.

Do not add any water to this mix.
 
Trim both ends of each turmeric leaf. 

Drain all water off the leaves and wipe each leaf dry.

Spread evenly 1 tbsp. of the rice batter on the darker side of the leaving a narrow edge of leaf all around.

Spread a little choorna in a straight line down the middle of the rice batter.

Fold the leaf length-wise into half.

Make similar patholis with all the leaves.

Steam the patholis in a idli steamer for 12 minutes (without shutting the pressure vent)
