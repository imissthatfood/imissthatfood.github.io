# Method

Boil milk, add juice of one lime, and boil again till it separates.

Then drain out the whey, and use only the milk solids.

Grind with the other ingredients, and cook on a slow fire, till the mixture leaves the sides of the vessel.

Pour onto a greased thali and cool.

Cut with a sharp knife, or the edge of a stainless steel thali into rectangular pieces.
