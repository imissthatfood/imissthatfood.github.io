# Method

Make the masala with coconut, tamarind, coriander, chillies and salt.

Remove the masala and add finely cut onion and brinjal and keep aside.

Prepare seasoning with 2 tablespoons of oil and mustard seeds and then put the brinjal and the masala.

Add the masala water and cook.

When the brinjal is cooked, open the lid, and keep on a small flame till done.

Thicken till dry on open flame.

Ladyâ€™s finger sagle can be made similarly. 

Cut bhindi into pieces 1 1/2 inches long.

 The masala is the same as for brinjal sagle but a few seeds of methi can be roasted and ground with masala.

This sagle can be made with lady finger only, or by adding an onion finely chopped after making the masala

If small brinjals are used, they can be stuffed with masala. 

In case of big ones, they can be cut into pieces of the desired size.
