**Macaroons**

Time: Bake for approx. 20 minutes
Donâ€™t get uptight on the weights of the cashew and the icing sugar. I keep adding a mixture of these two (equal quantities)  spoon by spoon until a spoonful of the mixture stands firm on the grease proof paper, without liquid running out. This is because the size of the egg white can vary.
After placing the mounds on the greaseproof paper (use two teaspoons), let it sit for awhile (about 10-15 mins).
Bake at 130 about 20 mins. 

Readiness test: slightly offwhite and base barely brown.
Leave to cool for two hours on the paper.

*Milk Cream*

Time: 80 mins on slow fire, stirring till tracks form 
20 mins after sugar is added
10-20 mins after all the ingredients are added.
Absolutely do not let any cream/film form either on the surface or on the sides of the vessel. This is what causes the milk cream to get brown.

Readiness test: forms a mass. A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar and a small ball dropped into a glass water will hold its shape and not blur into the water. Water stays absolutely clear.


*Date Roll*

Time: about 60 mins but will depend on the level of heat and the pan and how much water you add while grinding.
Chop the dates finely. 
Soak in a little warm water
Dry the milk down till it leaves a track in the pan. For this sweet, high heat is fine.
Remember to taste the walnuts as they look good but could sometimes taste sour and oily.

Readiness test: forms a mass. A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar

*Marzipan*

Time: about 45 mins but will depend on the level of heat and the pan and how much water you add while grinding.
Soak OVERNIGHT.
Remove all traces of skin from the cashews.
Grind with minimum water.
The original recipe says one wineglass of rose water. This is 40-50 ml to taste. 
The aunties would add almond essence. Use very sparingly. 
I add sugar 1.5 times the cashew weight while cooking. 

Readiness test: Becomes whitish on the edges and begins to form a mass. A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar.
Add extra icing sugar as needed while kneading and almost cold.


*Bolines* 

Time: Bake for 45 mins @ 140 degrees Celcius
Each should weigh 16-18 grams (one tablespoon approx.) 
Portion, form balls, refrigerate till firm.
Bake at 140 for 45 mins.
Must make mixture and let it stand for at least 3 hours.
If the mixture is too sticky you can add very little rava.

Readiness test: slightly opaque and base barely brown. Firm to touch. Will harden as they cool.

*Culculs*

Sugar syrup at 230-240 degrees Celcius is perfect.
Use a spider and dip the fried cooled culculs in the sugar.
Shake away excess sugar.
Spread loosely on greaseproof paper.
I cover my entire kitchen platform with greaseproof paper so they can spread out  well.

*Cake*
Double greaseproof paper on the base and sides, alternate base, then side then base then side
After baking leave it outside for a wekk
Add alcohol after a week. 
Double cover in foil.
Repeat twice.
