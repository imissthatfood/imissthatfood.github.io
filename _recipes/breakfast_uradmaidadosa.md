# Method

Soak urad dhal for 2 hours.

Grind finely to a paste, adding water.

Add salt, and keep overnight.

Next morning, mix in the maida, beat well and make dosas.

Note: Maida can be mixed in water the previous night. 

Next morning remove the extra water and add maida to the ground urad dhal. 

The batter should ferment well.

Some people prefer non-fermented dosa also in which case you have to grind urad dhal 
mix maida and prepare the dosa immediately.
