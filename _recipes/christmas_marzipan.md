_Everybody’s all time favourite. This is Grand-ma’s original recipe. If you follow the recipe , it will probably be too sweet for today’s tastes.  I always lessen the amount of icing sugar I add at the end. Also use almond essence or rose water but not both. I love almond marzipan, but everybody else loves cashew. The almond paste appears grainier when cooking but the finished product is much smoother._

# Method

Grind the nuts with the egg whites, the rose water and the powdered sugar till smooth.

Cook on a slow fire until it is thick and heavy and leaves the vessel in a lump.

Allow to cool and then knead in the icing sugar as required.
 
I usually use about 100 grams less than what the recipe states.

**My tips:**

Time: about 45 mins but will depend on the level of heat and the pan and how much water you add while grinding.

Soak Cashews OVERNIGHT. Remove all traces of skin from the cashews. Grind with minimum water.

The original recipe says one wineglass of rose water. This is 40-50 ml to taste. 

The aunties would add almond essence. Use very sparingly. 

I add sugar 1.5 times the cashew weight while cooking. Add extra icing sugar as needed while kneading and almost cold.

Readiness test:

Becomes whitish on the edges and begins to form a mass. A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar.
