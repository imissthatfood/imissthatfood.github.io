# Method

Heat the ghee, add the spices, and fry well till aroma.

Add the soaked and drained rice and then fry till all the water dries and the sound stops.

Add 1 1/2 cup hot water and 1 teaspoon of salt and peas.

Stir well, and cover and cook on a low fire until the water is all absorbed and the grains are separate.

Cool and then separate grains with a fork.

If you add juice of 1/2 a lemon, the grains separate well, and the rice whitens a bit.

 Tastes real good too.
