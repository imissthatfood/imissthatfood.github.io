# Method

Mix all ingredients together and marinate for 3 hours in the refrigerator. 

Shape into sausage like patties and lightly fry on a griddle.

(This is cheating – just helps to keep it’s shape while it’s grilling on the barbeque) 

Then skewer them and cook on the open fire, turning and basting all the time.

If you are not BBQing, then fry on a low stove till liquid runs clear.

Grill on wooden skewers.

_Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they don’t burn while grilling._
