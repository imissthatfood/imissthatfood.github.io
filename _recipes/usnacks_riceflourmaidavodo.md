# Method

In a kadai, heat oil, add mustard.

When the mustard seeds splutter, add curry leaves and coriander leaves.

When they change colour, add water and salt.

When the water boils, keep the kadai down from the gas.

And add the mixed four.

Mix well so that it forms into a ball.

When cool, make lime sized balls flatten and fry.

_These bondas can be eaten with tomato sauce or coriander leaf chutney._
