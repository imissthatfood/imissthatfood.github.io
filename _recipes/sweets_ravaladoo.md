# Method

Heat ghee in a pan and put in the cashews, then raisins and last the rava.

Roast till the rava gives and aroma and becomes slightly brown in colour.

Remove from the flame.

Make sugar syrup in another pan, adding just enough water to cover the sugar.

When the sugar melts, add grated copra or coconut.

When the syrup is made that can be drawn into strings remove.

Add roasted rava, 1 tablespoon ghee, cloves and cardamom powder.

When cool, make ladoos.

Be careful when making the syrup because if the syrup is overdone, then the rava ladoos become very hard.
