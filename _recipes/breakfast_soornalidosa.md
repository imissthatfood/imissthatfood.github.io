# Method

Soak rice, methi together for 2 hours and wash.

Grind this with coconut gratings.

Before removing the batter add salt

Remove the batter in a vessel which contains poha.

Keep the batter overnight.

Make dosa the next morning after beating the batter well.

The dosas are to be made like mushti dosas.

_If the batter is not fermented well, the dosas become hard in which case you can add 1/4 teaspoon soda bicarbonate powder before preparing the dosas. 

(1/2 glass buttermilk can be added while grinding)_
