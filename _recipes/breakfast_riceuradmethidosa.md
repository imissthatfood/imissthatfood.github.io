# Method

Rice, urad dhal and methi can be soaked together for 2 hours.

Wash and grind well and just before removing, add salt.

Keep overnight and make dosas the next morning.

With the same measures masala dosa can be made.

It is better to soak rice and dhal separately.

Grind dhal first and when fine, add the soaked rice and methi.

Should ferment well.

The bhaji is the same as the one to be eaten with puris.

Eat masala dosa with Ginger Chutney.
