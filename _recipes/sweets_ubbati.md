# Method

Cook Bengal gram.

When well cooked remove water, add sugar or jaggery to dhal and keep on flame.

When sugar is well absorbed keep down the vessel and grind finely in the grinder.

Remove, add cardamom powder and make into balls.

Mix turmeric powder, powdered sugar in water and maida and knead the dough (to puri dough consistency).

Add the oil, knead well and keep the dough for at least 2-3 hours.

Then make a ball with maida dough, roll a little (like a small puri),

Keep the Bengal gram ball in the center, bring the edges in such a way that a ball is formed.

Roll and roast on both sides on a slow fire without oil or ghee.

Ubbati will get spoilt in 2-3 days if not refrigerated.
