_This is the recipe for the puffed pani puris but they are troublesome to make, but very tasty. If I need a small quantity, I prefer to make them.
 You need boiled and diced potato, soaked boondi, boiled moong, geera pani, swet tamarind chutney._

# Method

Sift dry ingredients together and add all the water at once.

Knead hard for 10 minutes.

The dough should be the consistency of bread dough, so add small amounts of flour or water as required.

Cover and let rest for 30 minutes.

Roll out puris about 2 inches in diameter, and cover with a damp tea towel.

Let the pastry rest for 15 minutes before frying.

When the ghee/oil is smoking hot, fry 3 puris at a time, making sure to splash oil over them so that they puff well.

Drain, cool and store in an airtight tin.

_I usually roll out a big piece of dough and then cut out the puris with a glass or a katori. Works fine._
