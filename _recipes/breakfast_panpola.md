# Method

Soak rice for 2 – 3 hours.

Grind rice with the coconut.

Add salt last.

This batter should be very thin.

Dosas are to be prepared immediately after making the batter.

There is no need for fermenting.

This dosa can be eaten with chutney or jaggery rava.

These dosas are not flipped.

Jaggery Rava:
Dissolve jaggery in water and bring to the boil. Melt and add ghee, and crushed pepper and elaichi.

_ This dosa can be prepared with just 2 – 3 tablespoons of grated coconut or even without coconut._

Grind rice with or without coconut.

 Add salt before removing the batter. 
 
 Add hot but not boiling water to the batter to the required consistency, and prepare the dosas.
