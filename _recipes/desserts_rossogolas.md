# Method

Break this milk with 3 lemons as follows:

Boil the milk.

Add lemons and stir till the whey separates.

Add 1/2 a cup of ice or cold water.

Stir and leave to stand.

Hang the curds in a muslin cloth until completely dry.

Blend in a processor till it just forms a ball with a smooth surface.

(Has to pass to a granular phase first) DO NOT over mix!

Shape into small balls.

Boil sugar and water together in a pressure cooker and add the rossogolas.

Full pressure.

Switch off.

Open after less than 5 mins.
