# Method

What I do is fry each ingredient separately and then put them together and simmer for awhile.

Last I add the juice of a lime. 
 
This way, all ingredients including the bread are well soaked in all the masalas. 

But--- the bread does not remain crisp.

That's the way we like it, but, you can add the fried bread cubes just before stuffing.
