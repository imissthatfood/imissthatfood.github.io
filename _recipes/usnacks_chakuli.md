# Method



Mix and sieve together the four flours.

Tie the mix in a fine cloth and steam (without shutting the pressure vent) in a cooker for 20 minutes.

Remove, crumble well and sieve again.

Add chilli powder, salt, til, jeera and water.

Knead well to form into dough with the consistency of chapati dough.

Press little balls of dough through the murku mould on to a sheet of paper to make murku shapes. 

Deep fry four or five murkus at a time in oil.
