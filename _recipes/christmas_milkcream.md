# Ingredients

* 1 litre milk
* 2 cups bura sugar ( I use 1/4 cup less)
* 125 grams grated cashew
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 1 tablespoon butter

# Method

Boil milk, stir continuously, for about 35 minutes, till the milk becomes thick and you can see the bottom of the pan.

Add sugar, continue stirring for about 10 minutes.

Add cashews and last vanilla and butter.

Cook till thick and heavy.

Mould the next day.
 


My tips:

Time: 80 mins on slow fire, stirring till tracks form 

20 mins after sugar is added

10-20 mins after all the ingredients are added.

Absolutely do not let any cream/film form either on the surface or on the sides of the vessel.
 
This is what causes the milk cream to get brown.

Readiness test:

Forms a mass.

A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar.

A small ball dropped into a glass water will hold its shape and not blur into the water. 

Water stays absolutely clear.
