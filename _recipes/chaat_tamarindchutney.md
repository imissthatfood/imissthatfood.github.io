# Method

Soak tamarind. Boil tamarind until it thickens. Remove all pulp seeds and fibre.

Grind the cooled tamarind  with the dates to a fine paste with very little water.

Strain if you think its necessary.

Cook this on a low flame for 3 or 4 minutes.

Add jaggery and mix it with the paste. Continue to cook till it becomes thick.

Add spice powders and mix.

Now you can add sugar to make the sweetness level to your taste.
