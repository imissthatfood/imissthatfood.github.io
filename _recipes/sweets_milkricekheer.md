# Method

Wash and cook rice and sago in milk, stirring while cooking.

When rice is cooked add sugar.

When sugar is dissolved add cardamom powder and saffron.

Garnish will cashewnuts and raisins roasted in a little ghee.

Doodh paak can be prepared with rice only.

It can also be made only with sago.

Sago kheer becomes very thick.

So be careful to use very little sago.

Doodh paak can also be prepared with readymade vermicelli.

If it is prepared with vermicelli it should be roasted in ghee to a light brown colour and then cooked in milk.

When vermicelli is cooked add sugar.

Garnishing is the same.
