_A Sheila was the only one to make these initially, and we all used to wait for her Christmas plate to grab this and the date bars. Now it is everybody’s favourite._

# Method

Preheat the oven to 130 

Keep ready a baking tray, lined with foil and lightly greased. (This is Bel’s tip- so much easier than butter paper and absolutely tension-free!) I use parchment paper

Beat the egg whites really well till they form stiff peaks.

Fold in the sifted icing sugar and then the chopped cashews.

Remember that the macaroons will expand a lot during baking, so place small heaps of the mixture on the baking tray, keeping a distance between them.

Bake till the macaroon is slightly cream in colour and the base of the macaroon becomes brownish. (About 20 minutes)

The surface will also lose its shine.

Remove from the tray when cool.

**My Tips:**

Don’t be too focussed on the weights of the cashew and the icing sugar. I keep adding a mixture of these two (equal quantities) spoon by spoon the mixture stands firm on the grease proof paper, without liquid running out. This is because the size of the egg white can vary.

After placing the mounds on the greaseproof paper (use two teaspoons), let it sit for awhile (about 10-15 mins).

Readiness test: slightly offwhite and base barely brown.

Leave to cool for two hours on the paper.
