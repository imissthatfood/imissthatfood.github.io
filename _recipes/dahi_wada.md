# Method

Soak urad dhal for at least four hours. 

Grind with the minimum amount of water that you can manage with, till smooth and buttery and bubbles rise to the surface. 

Then add the chillies, curry leaves and the salt and grind again. 

Wet the palms of your hands, and take a little of the batter in the palm, shape and gently ease it into the medium hot oil you have ready.
 
Do not make the oil too hot. 

Drain on paper. 

When cool immerse in salted water. 

When they have soaked well press them between the palms of your hands to remove excess water. 

Then soak in yoghurt beaten with sugar and salt to taste. 

Garnish with the powders and serve with tamarind chutney.
