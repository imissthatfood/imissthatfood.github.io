_A Sheila was the only one to make these initially, and we all used to wait for her Christmas plate to grab this and the date bars. Now it is everybody’s favourite._


# Ingredients

* 2 Egg whites
* 200 grams icing sugar
* 200 grams chopped cashew




# Method

Preheat the oven to the lowest setting.

Keep ready a baking tray, lined with foil and lightly greased. (This is Bel’s tip- so much easier than butter paper and absolutely tension-free!) I use parchment paper

Beat the egg whites really well till they form stiff peaks.

Fold in the sifted icing sugar and then the chopped cashews.

Remember that the macaroons will expand a lot during baking, so place small heaps of the mixture on the baking tray, keeping a distance between them.

Bake till the macaroon is slightly cream in colour and the base of the macaroon becomes brownish.

The surface will also lose its shine.

Remove from the tray when cool.
