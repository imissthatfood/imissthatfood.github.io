_This is as close as I can get to Badshah’s Falooda. Remember – spending a sweltering day shopping and then walking into airconditioned Badshah’s – Falooda in Heaven!!!!_


# Ingredients

* Kulfi
* Rose syrup
* Sabja (tukmaria seeds) ( Soak a little in 1/2 a cup of water drain and use immediately)
* Falooda sev
* Dried down milk ( semi-solid)
 
You could use kewra/ kesar flavouring but I like to stick to the original.

Falooda sev:
Sev press with medium-fine holed plate
* 1 cup cornflour
* 2 cups water
* ice cold water


 

# Method

Mix cornflour and water.

Cook on slow fire, stirring continuously, till transparent.

If required add few more tbsp. water while cooking.

Mixture when cooked should be transparent and can be sticky.

Oil inside of press. Spoon in cooked mixture.

Hold press over a large bowl of iced water.

Press out spaghetti like sev into water.

Do not disturb by stirring.

Keep in refrigerator to chill till required.

Drain in colander before using.
