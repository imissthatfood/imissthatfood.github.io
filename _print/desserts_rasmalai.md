_This recipe is from Bel. She says, that you have to try it a couple of times and see what works for you, as depending on the ingredients, processing time will be different_


# Ingredients

* 1 litre Fresh Milk (Full Fat)

* 3 lemons â€¦ juice


# Method
Bring the milk to the boil.

Add lemons.

Switch off the heat.

Stir until the whey separates.

Add one cup of iced water.

Tie the curd in a cloth until very dry.

Put in a food processor.

Pulse till it just forms a soft ball with a smooth surface. (It will pass through a granular phase)

Do not over process

Make a syrup with two cups of sugar and 5 cups of water.

Add the balls and heat to full pressure.

Remove from heat.

Open after 3-5 minutes.

If you are making rasmalai, then you need to flatten the balls, to make thick oval shapes. 

(This is before cooking in the pressure cooker)

Mix one can of condensed milk with a litre of milk.

Add kesar and chopped pistas.

Add the cooked rasmalais.

Chill.
