_Serve with naan, pudina chutney and tamarind chutney._


# Ingredients

* 1 kilo prawn de-veined
* 1 teaspoon garlic crushed
* 1 teaspoon ginger crushed
* 1 tablespoon chopped coriander
* 1 tablespoon chopped chillies
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder
* mace
* 1/2 cup yoghurt
* tandoori colour


# Method
Clean and de-vein the prawns. 

If you are grilling, leave the tail on. 

If the prawns are too big, butterfly them.

Mix all ingredients together well.

Then add the prawn and marinate. 

Grill 5-6 minutes on each side and brush with ghee. Alternatively bake in a hot oven for 10-12 minutes.

Grill on wooden skewers.

_To de-vein easily, remove the shell and the head, leave just the end of the tail on if you want it. Hold the tail end and insert a pin/skewer just near it, below the vein. Lift gently and the vein should ease out with minimum effort._

_Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they donâ€™t burn while grilling._
