_This is a Sheila’s recipe. Neha and Meghna love making culculs with me, but found Grand-ma’s stories of using combs to make them really disgusting. Till she enlightened them with the fact that new combs for the house were always bought at Christmas, and used first for making culculs. I prefer the shells. I think they taste better and don’t look so much like “fat grubs!”!_


# Ingredients

* 1 kilo maida
* 2 tablespoons ghee
* 4 eggs
* pinch of salt



# Method

Beat eggs separately first and then make a dough with water.

Keep aside for at least 4 hours.

Then make the culculs.

Don’t place them one over another as they will stick together.

Fry in ghee or ghee flavoured oil, until you hear a sound as they move against each other.

They should be crisp but not brown.

Make a sugar syrup of 3 measures sugar to 2 measures water.

Boil together add colour, till a drop of the syrup in water stays a soft ball .

Then you can dip the fried culculs in.

Test a few first. I find this step difficult to judge.
 
_Work fast but be careful, the syrup can burn you badly!_
