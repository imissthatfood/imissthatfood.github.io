_A Dorothy’s recipe, ( I think) she had made it for all of us at one of the many wedding decoration meetings in Reminess. Serve with naan, pudina chutney andtamarind chutney._


# Ingredients

* 1/2 kilo mutton kheema (mince twice)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon chilli powder
* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder
* 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
* 1 teaspoon methi
* 2 teaspoons corn flour
* 2 teaspoons cashew
* 1 teaspoon ginger
* 1 teaspoon garlic
* 1 teaspoon chopped coriander
* 1 teaspoon chopped chillies
* 1 egg


# Method

Mix all ingredients together and marinate for 3 hours in the refrigerator. 

Shape into sausage like patties and lightly fry on a griddle.

(This is cheating – just helps to keep it’s shape while it’s grilling on the barbeque) 

Then skewer them and cook on the open fire, turning and basting all the time.

If you are not BBQing, then fry on a low stove till liquid runs clear.

Grill on wooden skewers.

_Remember to soak the skewers in water earlier, so that they don’t burn while grilling._
