_This is A. Cleffie’s or Nicola’s recipe, I’m not sure who. But they turn out really well_


# Ingredients

* 3 cups maida or plain flour
* less than 1/4 kilo Amul Butter
* 125 grams bura sugar (powdered sugar)
* 2 whole eggs
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla essence
* 100 grams grated cashews




# Method

Mix all ingredients except cashew together.

Make small balls.

Dip in egg white, coat in grated cashews and make a dip on the top.

The original way is to put jam in the dip, but lots of people put glace cherries. Your choice.

Place on a greased thali and bake till light brown on the base.
