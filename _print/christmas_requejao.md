_This is A Dolcie’s recipe. If you are really good and follow the recipe exactly, it turns out well, iF you aren’t it will become crusty and the centre will be soft and chewy. I remember sitting at her bed in Boran, and asking her how to make this the right way._


# Ingredients

* 400 grams almonds finely ground
* 1 kilo sugar
8 eggwhites
* curd of 1 litre full cream milk.



# Method

Boil milk, add juice of one lime, and boil again till it separates.

Then drain out the whey, and use only the milk solids.

Grind with the other ingredients, and cook on a slow fire, till the mixture leaves the sides of the vessel.

Pour onto a greased thali and cool.

Cut with a sharp knife, or the edge of a stainless steel thali into rectangular pieces.
