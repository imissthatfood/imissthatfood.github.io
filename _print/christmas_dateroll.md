_Do you remember the wet tea-towels, and Mummy with her hands all red from handling the hot sweet? None of that now, it’s much easier this way, and there is no compromise on the taste_


# Ingredients

* 400 grams sugar
* 400 grams seedless dates (use dark ones)
* 200 grams walnuts
* 50 grams butter
* 1 litre milk
* Vanilla essence




# Method

Dry down the milk till it is almost semisolid – when you stir it, the spoon should leave a track showing the bottom of the vessel.

Add sugar butter and vanilla essence and the dates.

Cook till the mixture leaves the side of the vessel.

Add the chopped walnuts.

Let it cool a bit.

Grease palms with butter/ghee.

Make small balls, flatten to discs and roll in icing sugar.

If you like you can flatten the sides with a knife.
