_This is a great recipe, but I don’t get consistency with it. Sometimes I feel I do everything right but then, it flops!! But when it turns out right, it’s wonderful!_


# Ingredients

* 8 tablespoons full cream milk powder
* 3 tablespoons self raising flour 1
* 1/4 teaspoon soda bicarbonate powder
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom
* 1 tablespoon ghee
* 3 tablespoons water ( approx )

Syrup
* 2 cups sugar
* 4 cups water
* 5 bruised cardamom pods



# Method


Sift dry ingredients together and rub in ghee, and add just enough water to give a firm yet pliable dough.

Mould into small marbles.

I put chopped pistas and a pinch of sugar inside each.

Fry very slowly in ghee, very gentle heat.

Make the syrup and soak the gulab jamuns in it till soft and spongy.

Add rose essence when just cool.
