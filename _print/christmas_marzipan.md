_Everybody’s all time favourite. This is Grand-ma’s original recipe. If you follow the recipe , it will probably be too sweet for today’s tastes.  I always lessen the amount of icing sugar I add at the end. Also use almond essence or rose water but not both. I love almond marzipan, but everybody else loves cashew. The almond paste appears grainier when cooking but the finished product is much smoother._


# Ingredients

* 400 grams cashew/ almonds Blanch, clean and soak
* 400 grams powdered sugar
* 400 grams icing sugar
* 3 egg whites
* Rose water



# Method

Grind the nuts with the egg whites, the rose water and the powdered sugar till smooth.

Cook on a slow fire until it is thick and heavy and leaves the vessel in a lump.

Allow to cool and then knead in the icing sugar as required.
 
I usually use about 100 grams less than what the recipe states.
