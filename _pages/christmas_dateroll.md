_Do you remember the wet tea-towels, and Mummy with her hands all red from handling the hot sweet? None of that now, it’s much easier this way, and there is no compromise on the taste_

# Ingredients

# Method

Dry down the milk till it is almost semisolid – when you stir it, the spoon should leave a track showing the bottom of the vessel.

Add sugar butter and vanilla essence and the dates.

Cook till the mixture leaves the side of the vessel.

Add the chopped walnuts.

Let it cool a bit.

Grease palms with butter/ghee.

Make small balls, flatten to discs and roll in icing sugar.

If you like you can flatten the sides with a knife.

**My Tips:**

Time: about 60 mins but will depend on the level of heat and the pan.

Chop the dates finely. Soak in a little warm water

For this sweet, high heat is fine.

Remember to taste the walnuts as they may look good but could sometimes taste sour and oily.

Readiness test: forms a mass. A small ball will hold its shape in icing sugar
