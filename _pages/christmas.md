Christmas in Bandra .... How we all miss that...

Shopping on Hill Road

ready-made sweets overflowing on the stalls outside Cheap Jack, Eureka and Mulchand,

Midnight Mass, buying the huge balloons for Neha and Meghna after Mass
 
.. but most of all.... Home-made sweets... the making and the eating, the giving and  the receiving, and the inevitable eating and the bloating!
