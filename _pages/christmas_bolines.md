# Method

Mix the sugar and the coconut in just a little water and stir on a medium flame until it feels stringy. 

Mix in the beaten eggs and the soogee. 

Keep aside for at least three hours.

Roll into small spheres and bake in a preheated (low setting) oven, on a lightly greased cake tray. Bake for 45 mins @ 140 degrees Celcius

When they are ready, the surface will become dull, and the base slightly brownish.

_Be careful, these go from almost done to scorched in the blink of an eye!_

**My tips**


Each should weigh 16-18 grams (one tablespoon approx.) Portion, form balls, refrigerate till firm.

Must make mixture and let it stand for at least 3 hours. If the mixture is too sticky you can add very little additional rava.

Readiness test: slightly opaque and base barely brown. Firm to touch. Will harden as they cool.
